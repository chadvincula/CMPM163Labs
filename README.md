## Lab 3  
[Video of 4 Cubes](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1glBU7U0A-sg660rtpf8CkN4yMhhIApfE)  
The first cube on the left was made using 6 wireframe + flatshaded MeshToonMaterials, each with a different color.  
The second cube on the left was made using the MeshPhongMaterial with a green specular color.  
The next cube was made using an example shader that apparently interpolates between a color called Perano and Aquamarine.  
The farthest cube on the right was made by mapping the material's x, y, and z coordinate to an r, g, and b value respectively.
